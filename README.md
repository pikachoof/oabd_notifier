# abd_notifier
A notifier application in python with customizable timers.

# Features:
## Add timer
Create a new timer with a name and set its interval

## Toggle Status of timer
If you don't wanna use, or want to enable a timer, click on the timer, and then press "Toggle Status" to disable/enable it.

## Save timers to "timers.txt"
You can save your newly created timers so they load upon the next launch of the application.

## Load timers from file
In the "timers.txt" file you can set up the timers in text form, and later load them upon launching the application.

## Delete timer
If you don't wanna use a timer anymore, just delete it by cliking on the timer and then clicking "Delete Selected".

# How it works:
1) Upon launching the `main.py` file, the timers will be loaded from the timsers.txt file
2) Manage your timers by Adding, Saving, Toggling and Deleting them.
3) After you launch RobloxPlayerLauncher.exe, the *Active* timers will automatically start their countdowns and print a screen notification that the time is up.
